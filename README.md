# ProDay

This is a project for TechNova 2022.
Website: https://emmayly.github.io/uwmath-simulator/

## Inspiration
Covid-19 has been negatively impacting people's lives in all aspects. We are trying to figure out ways to help people stay mentally relaxed and live a better life.

## What it does
Our website is divided into three parts. The first part provides three easy-to-use online tools that help people create to-do lists and schedules. The second part contains some useful life tips that promote happiness. The third part recommends three pieces of music to help people relax.

## How we built it
We firstly brainstormed different ideas in several dimensions and eventually narrowed down our topic to COVID-19 mental health. Based on this initial scheme, we utilized Figma to draft the layout of the website, containing four main informative pages and three subpages in ProMe part. Then we used HTML and CSS to develop our website with the help of GitHub to achieve collaboration.
